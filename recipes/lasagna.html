    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> Lasagna is a popular baked pasta dish of Italian origin, characterized by layers of flat pasta sheets alternating with fillings such as meat sauce (ragù), béchamel sauce (a creamy white sauce), and various cheeses. The dish is known for its rich, savory, and comforting flavor profile, often featuring a combination of umami, meat, and cheese.  </p>
    <p> The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which melts during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven (al forno). The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.</p>
