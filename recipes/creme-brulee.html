    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>Crème brûlée is a French dessert featuring a rich, vanilla-flavored custard base topped with a layer of caramelized sugar. The caramelized sugar is typically cracked open to reveal the smooth, creamy custard underneath. </p>
    <p> The dessert is enjoyed for its contrast in textures – a creamy custard beneath a crunchy, hardened sugar crust. </p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Heavy Cream </li>
        <li> White Sugar </li>

        <li> Bring a large pot of water to boil. While water is boiling, combine cream, 1/4 cup sugar and salt in saucepan over medium heat. Stir occasionally 4 to 5 minutes, until steam rises. In a medium bowl, beat egg yolks and vanilla until smooth. Pour hot cream into yolks, a little at a time, stirring constantly, until all cream is incorporated.
